    <h1>This page is <em>properly</em> written</h1>
    <p>
      There are many things wrong with this page. It's not so bad that it won't
      work on most browsers, but it has many things that could be written much
      better. Your job is to use this code as a starting point and improve it.
    </p>

    <h2>You could, of course, cheat!</h2>
    <p>
      There is nothing wrong with using an HTML cleaner such as HTMLTidy, nor in
      using an accessibility checker like the W3 site to ensure your code works
      well. In fact, we would highly recommend that you do this whenever you
      create web pages because they help to ensure your code is compatible with
      standards and accessible to as many people as possible. Similarly, it
      makes perfect sense to use a WYSIWYG HTML editor such as Dremweaver orthe
      open source KompoZer when actually writing web pages. For the purposes of
      this exercise, however, you may learn more effectively if you avoid doing
      that until you are fairly comfortable that you have made as many changes
      as you can with just the aid of references. The main reason we are
      learning HTML is so that we can write dynamic JavaScript programs that are
      embedded within and which use and manipulate HTML, CSS and other browser
      technologies. If you take short cuts at this point, you will find it
      <em>much</em> harder later on. Remember, while marks will be lost if you
      don't take care to deal with the problems on these pages, the main things
      we are looking for relate to your ability to use the technology well and
      effectively, paying close attention to the design needs you have already
      identified
    </p>
    <h3>Adding links</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="./sample2.html"
        >This is a link to the other page in this badly written pair of pages</a
      >. It uses a relative URL to point to a file in the same file system. This
      is necessary if you are building a site for portability, so that you can
      move it from one place (say your local computer) to another (say, your
      website).
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.athabascau.ca">
        And this is a link to Athabasca's main site.</a
      >
      It uses an absolute URL that points to a unique web address. When the site
      moves, it will still point to that same address.
    </p>
    <h3>Using pictures</h3>
    <p>
      Pictures are not a part of a web page - the HTML page includes a link that
      tells the browser to embed the image (if it can) and some extra optional
      attributes such as its position relative to the text. It is far preferable
      to use stylesheets for this kind of formatting, but that's a subject for
      the next unit.

        alt="AU University Logo"
        width="200px"
      />
    </p>

    <h3>Making lists</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>lists are useful</li>
      <li>for many things</li>
      <li>and can be unordered,</li>
      <ul>
        <li>indented,</li>
        <ol>
          <li>numbered</li>
          <li>like this</li>
        </ol>
      </ul>
      <li>and more</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Making tables</h3>
    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>Tables should only be used for tabular data</td>
        <td>and never for layout</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>but many people do</td>
        <td>use them for layout</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="2">
          It's not good for accessibility. Stylesheets work much better for this
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- 
    PROBLEMS:
No language defined for HTML
Title was blank
i tag was used instead of em
No meta tags that help browsers read your files properly as well as help with accessibility
Viewport not defined, which keeps the content scaled properly for different devices
Many closing tags missing including heading tags, paragraph tags and more.
Odd capitilized tags for no reason instead of consistance lower case html tags
Nesting mistakes in unordered list, opening tags missing >
list tags have no closing tags, bad practice
a tag href link for AU website not enclosed in quotes (bad practice)
img aulogo.gif uses a relative URL without providing the file, it should be using an absolute URL. 
img is missing alt text for accessibility
table rows and table data tags missing closing tags
-->
